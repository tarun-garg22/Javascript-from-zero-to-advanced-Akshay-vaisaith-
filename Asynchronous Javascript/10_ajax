// Basic theory
// AJAX : asynchronous programming and xml

// HTTP request
// is a set of "web development techniques"
// using many web-technologies on the "client-side"
// to create asynchronous web developments.

// with ajax , web applications can send and retrieve
// data from a server asynchronously (in the background)
// without interfering with the display and
// behaviour of the existing page

// We don't use data in xml format anymore
// we use JSON now.

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1.) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2.) fetch Api (new way to doing)
// 3.) axios (this is third party library)
